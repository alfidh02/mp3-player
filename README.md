# Android studio mp3-player project
For learning purpose and experimental. <br/>
You can edit the mp3 file by change it from raw directory (res->raw), also dont forget to edit your song title in MainActivity.java.<br/>
Happy Coding!

(p.s: big size file, pls make sure your internet quota is enough)
